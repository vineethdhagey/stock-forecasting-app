# 📈 Stock Price Forecast Dashboard
An interactive Streamlit web app for forecasting stock prices using multiple models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM.
The app fetches live historical data using Yahoo Finance, performs preprocessing, trains models, and provides forecasted stock prices along with evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE).

# 🚀 Features
**Multi-model support:** Choose between ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM for forecasting.

**Forecast horizon:** Predict stock prices for the next 7–14 days.

**Interactive Interface:** Built with Streamlit for an easy and smooth user experience.

**Evaluation Metrics:** View model performance with MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

**Visual Forecasts:** Last 30 days of actual data + future predictions.

**Data Source:** Pulls 5 years of daily data directly from Yahoo Finance.

**Stocks included:**

1) Apple (AAPL)

2) Tesla (TSLA)

3) JPMorgan (JPM)

**Currency:** All prices are displayed in USD.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Frontend:** Streamlit

**Models:**

1) ARIMA & SARIMA: statsmodels

2) Prophet: fbprophet (Prophet by Meta)

3) LSTM: TensorFlow/Keras

**Data:** yfinance for historical stock data

**Visualization:** matplotlib

# 🔄 How It Works
**Data Collection:**

The app automatically fetches 5 years of historical daily stock price data from Yahoo Finance.

**Preprocessing:**

Missing values are filled, and data is resampled to a daily frequency.

**Model Training:**

The selected model (ARIMA/SARIMA/Prophet/LSTM) is trained using this 5-year dataset.

**Forecasting:**

Forecasts for the next 7–14 days are generated and displayed.

**Evaluation:**

Key metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE) are calculated to assess prediction accuracy.
